\title{log likelihood and derivatives for chi-squared distribution}
\usage{
llikChisq(x, df, full = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{variable that is distributed by chi-squared distribution}

\item{df}{degrees of freedom (non-negative, but can be non-integer).}

\item{full}{Add the data frame showing x, mean, sd as well as the
fx and derivatives}
}
\value{
data frame with \code{fx} for the log pdf value of with \code{dDf}
that has the derivatives with respect to the \code{df} parameter
the observation time-point
}
