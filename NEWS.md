* Initial release, exports log-likelihood functions from 'stan' and
  their derivatives to R and C.  This allows linkage in 'rxode2' to
  allow generalized log-likelihood in 'nlmixr2'.
* This is a data like package and is likely not to change very much
  over time.
* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
