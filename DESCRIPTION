Description: 'rxode2' is a tool for for running simulations from
    ordinary differential equation ('ODE') models, such as
    pharmacometrics and other compartmental models.  This tool
    provides the log-likelihoods with the gradients from 'stan' needed
    for generalized log-likelihood estimation in 'nlmixr2'. This is
    split of to reduce computational burden of recompiling 'rxode2' if
    necessary and is data-like in that the distributions and
    derivatives are unlikely to change.
